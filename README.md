# 3. A "click to add new hire" button to add a new employee. This option will lead the user to an input form to add a new employee to the employee's database.

# 4. An "edit" button that allows an user to modify an employee's personal, functional or compensation data in order to reflect changes in the employee's profile.

# 5. A "delete" button to remove an ex-employee from the employee's database.
